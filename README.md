Data Analysis Methods

About

This repository contains a collection of data analysis labs aimed at teaching fundamental concepts in data exploration, visualization, and interpretation. Each lab leverages real-world data sets to uncover patterns, relationships, and distributions. Through hands-on exercises, users gain experience with cleaning, analyzing, and presenting data using Python and pandas.

Labs Overview

1. The Distribution of First Digits

Investigates the distribution of first and last digits in various numerical datasets. Labs cover:

Analyzing the first and last digit distributions in stock trading volumes.

Visualizing distributions of numerical data.

Drawing insights from comparisons against initial predictions.

2. Shark Tank Investment Analysis

Explores data on investments made in the reality TV show "Shark Tank." Labs include:

Cleaning and analyzing investment data.

Identifying the most valuable companies and highest investments.

Investigating funding trends by industry and shark preferences.

3. Evidence of Discrimination in California DDS Expenditures

Examines expenditure data to investigate potential discrimination in fund allocation by ethnicity. Labs include:

Comparing average expenditures for different ethnic groups.

Investigating expenditure trends by age cohorts.

Exploring discrepancies between overall averages and age-cohort-specific data.

4. Relationships between Variables

Focuses on understanding relationships between categorical and quantitative variables. Labs cover:

Creating contingency tables to summarize relationships.

Visualizing joint, marginal, and conditional distributions.

Exploring Titanic and restaurant tipping data sets to uncover patterns.

Skills Covered

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, converting data types, and preparing data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using descriptive statistics and visualizations to summarize data.

Data Visualization: Creating bar charts, histograms, box plots, and heat maps using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Statistical Concepts: Working with distributions (joint, marginal, conditional) and deriving meaningful insights.
